.. _overview:

Overview
========

I Sheet You Not is a workflow generator/template for `Alfred 3`_. It reads
data from an Excel workbook and displays it in Alfred. You can specify
which rows and columns the data are read from, and changes to the data
are picked up automatically by the workflow.


.. _download:

Download and installation
=========================

Download the latest version of the workflow from `GitHub releases`_.
Double-click the downloaded ``I-Sheet-You-Not-X.X.X.alfredworkflow`` file
to install in Alfred 3.


.. _usage:

Usage
=====

.. note::

    Check out the green demo objects in the workflow for examples of how
    to use and configure I Sheet You Not.

Use the keyword ``isyn`` to search for an Excel sheet and generate a new
workflow based on it.

You will be asked to specify a name for your new workflow, which will
then be created and added to Alfred.

You should then :ref:`configure the worksheet, first row and data columns in
the workflow configuration sheet <configuration>` (if the defaults are
unsuitable).

Alter one of the green demo objects in the workflow to suit your purpose (e.g.
change the Keyword, Placeholder Title and Subtext) or add your own, then
delete the other, unneeded objects.

.. important::

    Don't forget to delete the topmost red ``isyn`` Keywords and Actions
    from your new workflow to prevent duplicates in Alfred.


.. _configuration:

Configuration
=============

By default, the workflow pulls data from the first
row of the first worksheet in the workbook. The item title is pulled from
column A, the subtitle from column B and the value from column C.

To change these, use the ``SHEET``, ``START_ROW``, ``TITLE_COL``,
``SUBTITLE_COL`` and ``VALUE_COL`` options in the workflow configuration
sheet:

.. image:: _static/config_sheet.png
    :alt: Workflow configuration sheet

If ``SHEET`` is unset, it defaults to the first worksheet.

If ``START_ROW`` is unset, it defaults to the first row.

If ``TITLE_COL`` is unset, it defaults to the first column (i.e. column A).

If ``SUBTITLE_COL`` is unset, it defaults to the column after ``TITLE_COL``.

If ``VALUE_COL`` is unset, it defaults to the second column after ``TITLE_COL``.

.. important::

    All rows and columns must be specified as numbers, not letters, so
    set ``TITLE_COL`` to ``1`` for column A, ``2`` for column B etc.

    Only the title is required. If there are no data for subtitle or
    value in the spreadsheet, set ``SUBTITLE_COL`` and/or ``VALUE_COL`` to
    ``0``.

Configuration options may also be specified as options to the ``isyn``
command within the Script Filter:
